        <h2>Game Production Lab: <i>Unlawful</i></h2>
        <p>I worked on this game as a programmer alongside 9 other developers (not including the course's shared sound team) from various disciplines. My main focus was on the dialogue and procedural parts of the game, but I was also involved in the discovery, documentation, and fixing of bugs.</p>

        <h2>Local Multiplayer Tower Defense</h2>
        <p>This is a more polished version of my 3rd (and final) project for a game development course I took. It's a party tower defense game that supports up to 4 players by connecting xbox controllers (one player may use the mouse and keyboard).</p>

        <h2>First Person Shooter</h2>
        <p>This the 2nd project I made for the same game development course. It's a simple single-player FPS with some stealth and randomization elements to make it more replayable.</p>
